                    Power outlets are 120 volts (the same as in the United
                    States).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alcohol is not allowed to be served or sold between the
                    hours of midnight and 9:00 a.m.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The drinking age on Taniti is 18 and the drinking age is not
                    strictly enforced.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Many younger Tanitians speak fluent English. Very little
                    English is spoken in rural areas, especially by the older
                    residents.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is one hospital and several clinics. The hospital has
                    many multilingual employees.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Violent crime is very rare on Taniti, but as tourism
                    increases, there are more reports of pickpocketing and other
                    petty crimes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Taniti enjoys a large number of national holidays, and many
                    tourist attractions and restaurants will be closed on
                    holidays, so visitors should plan accordingly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, but many
                    businesses will also accept euros and yen. Several banks
                    facilitate currency exchange, and many businesses accept
                    major credit cards.
