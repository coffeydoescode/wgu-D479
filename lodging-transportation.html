            <h3>Lodging</h3>
            <p>
                Taniti has a wide variety of lodging that ranges from an
                inexpensive hostel to one large, four-star resort. There are
                many small, family-owned hotels and a growing number of bed and
                breakfasts. All types of lodging are strictly regulated and
                regularly inspected by the Tanitian government.
            </p>

                class="content-img"
            />

            <h3>Transportation</h3>
            <p>
                Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive
                on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one
                night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can
                accommodate small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the
                process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to
                land on the island within the next few years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m.
                every day. Private buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are
                available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a
                local rental agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets are
                available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by
                law). Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many
                tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this
                area is easy to explore on foot.
